Papis-dmenu
===========

This project contains several scripts for a picker based on [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) for papis v0.11.1.

Usage
-----

Change the `$PAPIS_HOME` variable in the script you want to run, and run `papis-cache.bash` to build the cache.

Then run `papis-open.bash` to open a papis file in mupdf, or run `papis-export.bash` to export the document's information in bibtex to xclip.
